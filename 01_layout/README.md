This folder contains several Dash apps from Ch. 2 of the Dash Tutorial, titled [Dash Layout](https://dash.plot.ly/getting-started). 

Major topics from the "Summary" section of the above link: 

### Layout
The `layout` of a Dash app describes what the app looks like. The `layout` is a hierarchical tree of components. 

### HTML Components
The `dash_html_components` library provides classes for all HTML tags and kwargs for all attributes on the tags.

### Dash Core Components
The `dash_core_components` library generates high-level components like controls and graphs.
